### How to Change Images:

**Method 1: Using URLs (Current)**
1. Go to `/src/data/products.js`
2. Find the product object you want to update
3. Replace the `image` URL with your new image URL
4. For best results, use images with these dimensions:
   - Product images: 800x1000px (4:5 ratio)
   - Hero images: 1920x1080px (16:9 ratio)
   - About images: 600x800px (3:4 ratio)

**Method 2: Upload Local Images**
1. Create the images folder: `/public/images/`
2. Upload your images to `/public/images/`
3. Update the image path in your code:
   ```javascript
   // Instead of URL
   image: "https://example.com/image.jpg"
   
   // Use local path
   image: "/images/your-image.jpg"
   ```
4. **Important**: Name your images using lowercase letters and hyphens only
   - ‚úÖ Good: `silk-evening-gown.jpg`
   - ‚ùå Bad: `Silk Evening Gown.jpg`

**Method 3: Upload to Rein-Uploads Folder**
1. Go to `/public/rein-uploads/`
2. Upload your images there
3. Reference them as: `/rein-uploads/your-image.jpg`

### Image Auto-Resizing
The website automatically handles different image ratios:
- **Product images** are cropped to 4:5 ratio (800x1000px equivalent)
- **Hero images** are cropped to 16:9 ratio (1920x1080px equivalent)  
- **About images** are cropped to 3:4 ratio (600x800px equivalent)
- Images maintain their aspect ratio and are centered within containers
- No manual resizing needed - upload any size image and it will display correctly

**Tip**: Always save image names lowercase and without spaces. Recommended format: `product-name1.jpg`
